The prisoner's dilemma is a problem where two prisoners have to decide whether to tell on each other or stay silent to determine their jail time. Here are the options: both tell on each other and serve 10 years, both stay silent and serve 5 years, one tells on the other and the one that stays silent goes to jail for 10 years while the other goes home free.

So I decided to make a program that simulates the dilemma 400 times over with the lack of prison years being replaced with points. The people will be replaced with bots that can remember what the other bot picks. Each bot has a different way of choosing.

The end goal of each bot is to get the highest average point score when going up against a variety of different bots.
